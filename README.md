Monte Carlo Tree Search Meets Deep Reinforcement Learning  
**Course Module: Deep Reinforcement Learning**  
**Date: Tuesday, April 22, 2025 (Lecture 26)**

## Context & Placement in the Course

This portfolio aligns with **Lecture 26: Deep Reinforcement Learning**, scheduled right after Quiz #6 and immediately before the course wrap-up. By this point, students have encountered classical search, adversarial search, game theory, and basic reinforcement learning. This portfolio extends those foundations to explore the synergy between **planning-based** methods like Monte Carlo Tree Search and **learning-based** methods like Deep Reinforcement Learning.

## How to Use This Portfolio

This portfolio is intended to fill a 75â€“120 minute session through a lecture which incorporates three mini-demos and one 2 min quiz. I've also included potential homework pairings - like podcasts, papers, and/or a design + implementation question.

### Slide Deck + Lecture Presentation  
Start by walking through the slide deck titled **"Planning vs. Learning: Monte Carlo Tree Search Meets Deep RL"**. This will signal when to go into the demos, which I've also linked here + added directly into the repo: 

1. **[MCTS on Tic-Tac-Toe](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1C_YQ4R9zgZVxJKcHhduGvvcIY0TBNt6U?usp=sharing)**
   
2. **[Q-Learning on GridWorld](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Fom7v6CkUxvBjOk3M9WoyZbh3gZoIG0f?usp=sharing)**
   
3. **[AlphaZero-inspired Hybrid Demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1FidqD6nxHPSKo1gcquqJHOBc--hP1lHk?usp=sharing)**

## Homework: Challenge 
- How would you combine MCTS and DRL for a medical diagnosis tool or autonomous car? Provide design and possible implementation details.
